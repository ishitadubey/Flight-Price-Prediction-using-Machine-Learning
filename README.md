# Flight-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

Flight Price Prediction model is used to predict the flight prices in earlier given the various parameters. The consumer’s perspective of purchasing airline tickets 
is difficult basically due to the fact that customers have inadequate statistics for reasoning approximate future price movements of the same. In this undertaking 
we simulate several models for computing anticipated future prices of flights. Airlines use state-of-the-art techniques which they call "Revenue management" 
or "Yield management". The most inexpensive available flight ticket on a given flight becomes more or less costly over time. This generally occurs to maximize 
sales to gain revenue primarily based on – 
1. Time of buy patterns (ensuring last-minute purchases are highly-priced)
2. Keeping the flight as complete as they need it (elevating expenses on a flight that is filling up)
A solution to this problem can assist airlines via means of predicting what costs they are able to maintain. It also can assist consumers to expect future flight costs 
and plan accordingly.


Conclusion - In this project we simulate various models for computing expected future prices. We’ve used the Gradient Boosting Regressor model in order to find the best fit line as far as our predictions and the actual prices are concerned. We received the r2_score of 87.69%. We classified existing models into customer side and airline side models based on their designed goals and then summarized, discussed the strengths and weaknesses of existing work.
